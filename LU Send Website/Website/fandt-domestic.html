            LU Send will categorize the different types of trips by placing them in one of four tiers based on funding, academic credit, LU Send’s involvement and students’ representation of Liberty University. Each event/trip should be registered with LU Send. After the initial registration, the Domestic Travel Coordinator will partner with the contact person through the entire registration/planning process to provide a wonderful experience for our students.<br /><br />
            <b>Tier 0</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Events that are approved by the provost for excused absences. <i>For example: Serve DC, LAWNVO practice, on-site departmental conferences, etc.</i></li>
              <li>Student Club trips endorsed by the corresponding department without a faculty/staff lead.</li>
              <li>Students traveling alone to career appropriate events endorsed by the department.</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Tier 1</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Faculty/staff planned/led field trips that are one-day trips with no overnight accommodations. <i>For Example: Labs, local excursions, Trips to DC, etc.</i></li>

            <b>Tier 2</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Faculty/staff planned/led trips that are overnight for 2-4 days.  <i>For Example: Conferences, competitions, etc.</i></li>

            <b>Tier 3</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Any trip that is 5 days or more becomes an LU Send trip planned/led by faculty/staff and supported by LU Send. This trip will need to incorporate the academic, cultural & service components that give an enhanced experience to our students.</li>

          <span class="summary">
            Domestic Student Travel encompasses a large variety of trips, but there are a few policies that apply to all travel:
            <ul>
              <li>Students cannot be leads on a trip, but GSAs can support leads on a trip.</li>
              <li>The academic lead needs to be qualified and approved if not the professor (such as a GSA or another faculty member)</li>
              <li>Overnight trips must have both a female and a male leader if there are both genders participating.</li>
              <li>All drivers must be approved by Transit to drive the vehicle chosen for the trip.</li>
              <li>Leaders taking students to an endorsed event outside the local area* should transport them with either a rental vehicle or an LU vehicle. </li>
              <li>Domestic Student Travel abides by Liberty University’s travel policies & procedures.</li>
            </ul>
            <i>*as per Liberty University’s travel policies, the local area is considered to be within 50 miles of campus.</i><br /><br />
            We take the safety and security of our students seriously, here are a few guidelines to help our leaders be prepared for possible situations:
            <ul>
              <li>Be conscious of how it would play out if one of the students becomes ill or injured and needs medical care. Who would stay with the student? Who would stay with the other students? Preferably, students should not be left alone without supervision. This would also apply to any situation that separates the group.</li>
              <li>Plan accordingly to eliminate as many Title IX situations as possible.</li>
              <li>Be aware of the liability of driving students in a personal vehicle as opposed to a rental or LU vehicle. It may be wise to budget for those last-minute traveling needs at the end of the semester/year.</li>
              <li>Advisable for all leaders to read Procurement’s Travel Policies & Procedures and Sign the Policy Acknowledgement Letter.</li>
              <li>Register your trip as soon as possible to ensure that all facets of the process are done in a timely manner.</li>
