                    "Studying abroad is amazing, yes; but it's not amazing all the time, as travel blogs and Instagram lead us to believe. Living abroad comes with a unique set of challenges that every person deals with differently. During my time abroad, God showed me the places in my life where I thought I was strong, but I really still needed to grow. Making new friends was hard; adjusting to a new educational system had its hurdles; and getting out of my comfort zone was a constant struggle for me. Living in a new culture is exciting, but it can also be hard to navigate, not just at first, but for weeks or even months. I really had to learn to depend on God and work hard to establish community while I lived in Spain. I was very thankful for the local church I found in Granada and the friendships I made with them there. I think the biggest lesson I learned is that not all of your expectations may be met going abroad; you may have to adjust some of them while you are there. In fact, you will have to. But you can still choose to make the most of the time while you are there. Don't waste the amazing opportunity you've been given to experience a different part of the world and enlarge your perspective on life."

                    “My time studying in Berlin Germany helped me see things from a broader perspective. Through many conversations I had with those I met, I gained a better understanding not only of cultures outside of the US but also of how these cultures view America. When people found out I was American questions almost immediately began about Trump, the proposed wall, and the why behind them both. But as I would talk to people about these things, I also began to understand their stance and why they held that position. It helped me to see things from a perspective that was not my own.<br /><br />
                    Over spring break I traveled to the UK. One evening, I was talking to some of the other guests at the hostel I was at; they were all from other parts of Europe. As we were talking about our different cultures and languages, one man from Greece pointed out how lucky I was. English is my first language and because of that I can easily converse with people from other countries. But for him and most Europeans, he was required to learn English as it is the common language that unites Europe and much of the world. It was this conversation and many others like it during my time in Europe that left me with a better understanding of the views of other cultures and how Americans are perceived.”

                    “Studying abroad was outrageously surreal. There are no words to accurately describe what an extraordinary experience it was to meet all kinds of people, experience a culture completely different than ours, and jump into something with blind faith. I was in Florence, Italy for eight weeks and I just have to brag on the personality of the town. The people were eager to share their customs with us, the architecture and art was stunning, and the amount I was able to learn in such a short time was incomparable. One takeaway I learned from this experience was how laid back an authentic Italian city is. We are very go-go-go, but Florence still held the unplugged charm of an older time. People stayed out late, spent hours talking over dinner, and stopped in the middle of the cobblestone streets to start a conversation... life was like something out of a movie. At first, this was a bit of a shock to me - I always feel like there is somewhere to be. Florentines are casual and want to spend time with each other. This trip reminded me that all the piles of stuff we collect in this life mean nothing in the end. Instead, we need to focus on our souls. Quality time is so important and taking the time to study abroad is definitely some healthy quality time we could all use. Florence has my heart; I so recommend venturing out there yourself so it can take yours.”

                    “I am not your typical college student. I’m studying for my Bachelor’s Degree online through Liberty University, at 46 years old, while working full time, with a husband, a daughter in college, and a son in High School.  But I promised myself, if I was going to do this degree program, I would take every opportunity available to me to enrich my life, such as LU Send.<br /><br />
                    Any apprehension that I might not be greeted warmly due to my age was quickly laid to rest upon meeting the charming students that I would get to have this incredible experience with.<br /><br />
                    What I learned on this trip was that I am a unique and multifaceted person that has very diverse interests, and this trip fed my soul.  Castles, museums and INCREDIBLE history around every corner.  Taking in the amazing surroundings of England and soaking up every educational opportunity at my fingertips, all while making incredible new friends and fulfilling my dream of seeing as much of God’s beautiful earth as possible, this trip was truly a gift.<br /><br />
                    Quite simply, studying abroad in London changed my life in a way that only God can.  It was a journey of self-discovery and self-love, and an incredible amount of fun.  God showed me what I am capable of on this trip, and there is no stopping me now.  I would not trade one moment of this experience for anything.<br /><br />
                    Follow your heart, listen to what God is saying to you, and go…study…abroad!”

                    “The four months I spent in Italy were the best four months of my life! From skiing the Alps to visiting small Italian villages to riding camels in the Sahara Desert, the experiences I had studying abroad were unforgettable. I traveled to eleven countries in Europe in addition to visiting Morocco, and while I had incredible fun traveling the world, I also learned more about different cultures and languages than I ever thought possible. I lived in a local’s city, so no one except my classmates spoke English, and thus, I had to learn to adapt my communication while trying to speak their language. Studying abroad also taught me to have greater trust in God. I had prayed for months that God would provide another Christian in my program, and sure enough, God provided, like He always does. Studying abroad was an experience of a lifetime and I would highly recommend that anyone who has a desire to learn about international cultures or simply experience life outside of the U.S. to study abroad!”
